# Vinted-data
 Vinted data & search from <a href="https://www.vinted.fr/" target="_blank">Vinted.fr</a>

Vinted data can be visualized in Google Sheets **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19CWMW9_0p9b-Qdog4iD9THiY_EY4nabcxF3emalAbqw/edit?usp=sharing)** or in this Google Data Studio **[report](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/ee24d510-f2ca-48d0-8c08-0ce32adc76f7)**. Those are actualized each day at 09:00 (GMT+2) and stored in Google sheets and in this GitHub repository in the folder **[DATA](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Vinted-data/tree/main/DATA)**. 


Currently the _BRAND ID_ is the one that take the most time to collect, as I didn't found a query to get all IDs with only one requests or just a few. Currently, data collection for this identifier is done with a query for each brand (more than 2.000 brands currently).
