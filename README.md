# Vinted-data
 Vinted data & search from [Vinted.fr](https://www.vinted.fr/)

Vinted data can be visualized in Google Sheets **[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19CWMW9_0p9b-Qdog4iD9THiY_EY4nabcxF3emalAbqw/edit?usp=sharing)**. Those are actualized each day at 09:00 (GMT+2) and stored in Google sheets and in this GitHub repository in the folder [DATA](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Vinted-data/tree/main/DATA).


Currently the _BRAND ID_ is the one that take the most time to collect, as I didn't found a search to get all IDs through only one requests or just a few. Currently the data collection for _BRAND IDs_ make a single request for each brand (more than 2.000 brands currently).
